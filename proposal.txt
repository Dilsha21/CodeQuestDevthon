Project Overview
Our project proposes a web-based application that
assists users with quickly locating the nearest pharmacy
where a required medicine is currently available. Beyond
convenience, the platform is designed with environmental
sustainability at its core by minimizing unnecessary travel,
reducing carbon emissions, and addressing inefficiencies in
medicine distribution and storage.
By combining real-time pharmacy inventory visibility with
eco-aware decision support, the system enables users to
choose pharmacies that result in the lowest environmental
impact while also supporting pharmacies in managing
stock more efficiently.
Problem Statement
Patients often travel long distances or visit multiple
pharmacies to find unavailable medicines, leading to
unnecessary fuel consumption, time loss, and increased
carbon emissions. Simultaneously, pharmacies struggle
with inaccurate demand forecasting, resulting in
overproduction, over-distribution, and medicine wastage
due to expiry.
While medicine shortages and pharmaceutical waste
continue to grow, there is currently no easy-to-use platform
that provides transparent visibility into medicine stock
levels while integrating sustainable pharmaceutical
practices for both suppliers and patients.
Proposed Solution
We propose a smart web application, MedFinder,
that connects users and pharmacies through a shared
system of real-time medicine availability, demand
prediction, and environmental impact awareness.
Users can search for required medicines and receive
recommendations for nearby pharmacies, minimizing
travel distance, time taken to acquire medicines in
time-critical situations, and associated carbon
footprint all with MediFinder. Pharmacies benefit
from AI-assisted demand forecasting, enabling
optimized stock planning and reduced wastage. The
platform also educates users on responsible medicine
disposal and sustainable consumption.

Key Features (1/2)
Public Medicine Stock Visibility
Users can search for medicines and view nearby
pharmacies with recently updated stock
information, improving transparency and
reducing unnecessary repeat visits.
Eco-Aware Pharmacy Recommendations
Pharmacies are suggested based on proximity,
estimated travel emissions, and the likelihood of
fulfilling the request in a single visit, helping
minimize avoidable travel.
Refill & Stock-Up Reminders
Users on long-term or daily medication receive
timely reminders to restock, helping prevent
treatment interruptions and reducing last
minute emergency trips.
Demand Forecasting Support for Pharmacies
Trend-based forecasting supports better
stocking decisions, reducing overstocking,
shortages, and medicine waste.
Sustainability-Aware Assistance Chatbot
An AI-powered chatbot provides general
guidance for minor ailments, helps identify
suitable over-the-counter medicine categories,
and directs users to appropriate nearby
pharmacies, while encouraging professional
consultation when needed.
Key Features (2/2)
User Sustainability Dashboard
A personal dashboard visualizes sustainable actions
taken, including reduced repeat trips, estimated
emissions avoided, and timely medication refills.
Medicine Use & Waste Reduction Guidance
In-app guidance promotes responsible medicine
use, donation pathways where applicable, and safe
disposal practices for unused or expired medicines.
Carbon Impact Insights
The platform provides indicative estimates of CO₂
emissions avoided through optimized pharmacy
selection and reduced repeat trips, clearly labeled
as estimates.

Innovation
The innovation of this project lies in combining healthcare
accessibility with environmental intelligence. Unlike
traditional pharmacy locator apps, this platform integrates
AI-powered demand forecasting, sustainability education
and carbon emission calculations all into a single
ecosystem.
The application transforms routine medicine purchasing
into an environmentally conscious decision-making process
while also helping pharmacies reduce waste and
operational inefficiencies.
Feasibility Analysis
The project is technically feasible using existing open
source frameworks, APIs, and machine learning libraries.
The modular architecture allows phased implementation,
starting with medicine availability tracking and gradually
introducing AI-driven features.
The development timeline fits well within the competition
constraints, and the required technologies are well
supported by current developer ecosystems.
Impact Assessment
Social Impact: Faster access to essential medicines,
especially crucial in emergency situations, and for
elderly and chronically ill patients.
Economic Impact: Improved inventory efficiency for
pharmacies, reducing losses from expired stock. 
Environmental Impact: Reduced carbon emissions
from unnecessary travel and decreased medicine
wastage.
Educational Impact: Increased public awareness of
sustainable medicine usage and disposal.
Additional Information
Preliminary research and informal surveys indicate
strong user interest in faster medicine access and
sustainability-focused digital solutions. The growing
emphasis on green technology and responsible
healthcare practices further supports the relevance and
scalability of this solution.
The platform is designed to scale regionally and
nationally, with robust security measures planned to
protect user data and pharmacy inventory information.
